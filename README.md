# Theme for Hugo

I am not the guy who design this theme. For the design, please refer to [jekyll chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy).

I like Hugo and chirpy, but chirpy is designed for Jekyll. That's why I wrote the theme for Hugo.

There is some function that is missing in my theme. 

- [ ] search
- [ ] better folder arrancement
- [ ] dark theme

If your like this theme and got some time to improve it. PRs are welcome.
