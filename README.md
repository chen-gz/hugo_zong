# Theme for Hugo

![image](https://github.com/chen-gz/hugo_zong/blob/42efad59a27f88b65cdde842ec1764d3bdf59a9f/samle.png)

I am not the guy who design this theme. For the design, please refer to [jekyll chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy).

I like Hugo and chirpy, but chirpy is designed for Jekyll. That's why I wrote the theme for Hugo.

There is some function that is missing in my theme. 

- [ ] better folder arrancement
- [ ] dark theme
- [x] search
- [x] copy code block


If your like this theme and got some time to improve it. PRs are welcome.
