# Theme for hugo

I am not the guy who design these theme. The design are refer to [jekyll chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy).

I like hugo and chirpy but chirpy is design for jekyll. That's why I wrote this this theme for hugo.

There are some function is missing in my theme.
